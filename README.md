## Design

There are three usecases that I want to support here

1. High level interface to software tooling allowing all syseng diagnostics collectable via tt-smi and tt-mod to be
readback and interacted with as a library.
    - This will only be a high level interface so it will only support pci connections and remote connections via pci
    - Will ignore all details of using communication channels such as which pci tlb or which erisc core to use.
1. General chip discovery and init, replacing create-ethernet-map and tt-smi wait. We'll probably also add the ability
to issue resets.
1. Low level syseng-only debug capability (via pyluwen)
    - To avoid needing to have multiple in flight stacks you will be able to drop down a level and access the
    implemented communication apis directly. Practically this means direct access to the types defined in luwen-ref.
    This means that you can modify pci tlbs and erisc cores being used or cut out the middle man entirely and
    issue raw calls.
