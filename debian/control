 # Luwen

 ## Design
 .
 There are three usecases that I want to support here
 .
 1. High level interface to software tooling allowing all syseng diagnostics
 collectable via tt-smi and tt-mod to be
 readback and interacted with as a library.
     - This will only be a high level interface so it will only support pci
 connections and remote connections via pci
     - Will ignore all details of using communication channels such as which pci
 tlb or which erisc core to use.
 1. General chip discovery and init, replacing create-ethernet-map and tt-smi
 wait. We'll probably also add the ability
 to issue resets.
 1. Low level syseng-only debug capability (via pyluwen)
     - To avoid needing to have multiple in flight stacks you will be able to
 drop down a level and access the
     implemented communication apis directly. Practically this means direct
 access to the types defined in luwen-ref.
     This means that you can modify pci tlbs and erisc cores being used or cut
 out the middle man entirely and
     issue raw calls.
